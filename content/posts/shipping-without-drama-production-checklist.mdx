# Shipping without drama: my checklist before production

After years of both smooth deployments and late-night emergency fixes, I've developed a comprehensive pre-production checklist that has dramatically reduced deployment stress and post-release issues.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Quality
- All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Code coverage above 80%
- No TypeScript errors or warnings
- ESLint and Prettier checks pass
- Security audit completed (`npm audit`)

### Performance
- Lighthouse score > 90 on mobile
- Bundle size analysis completed
- Core Web Vitals within targets
- Images optimized and properly sized
- Unused code removed

```bash
# Performance check script
npm run build
npm run analyze
lighthouse --mobile --chrome-flags="--headless" http://localhost:3000
```

### Accessibility
- Screen reader testing completed
- Keyboard navigation works
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA
- Alt text for all images
- Proper heading hierarchy

### SEO & Meta
- Meta descriptions and titles optimized
- Open Graph tags configured
- Sitemap updated
- Robots.txt configured
- Canonical URLs set

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Error tracking configured (Sentry)
- Analytics tracking verified
- Performance monitoring active
- Uptime monitoring configured
- Log aggregation working

## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deploy
1. **Feature freeze** - No new features 24h before deploy
2. **Staging verification** - Full QA pass on staging
3. **Database backup** - Always backup before migrations
4. **Team notification** - Alert team of upcoming deployment

### During Deploy
1. **Monitor metrics** - Watch error rates and performance
2. **Smoke tests** - Verify critical paths work
3. **Rollback plan** - Have one-click rollback ready
4. **Communication** - Keep stakeholders informed

### Post-Deploy
1. **Health checks** - Verify all systems operational
2. **Monitor for 30 minutes** - Watch for any issues
3. **User acceptance** - Get stakeholder sign-off
4. **Documentation** - Update deployment notes

## Emergency Procedures

Always have these ready:
- One-click rollback procedure
- Emergency contact list
- Incident response playbook
- Communication templates

## Key Takeaways

1. **Checklists prevent mistakes** - Even experienced developers miss things
2. **Automate what you can** - But verify automation works
3. **Monitor everything** - You can't fix what you can't see
4. **Plan for failure** - Have rollback and recovery procedures ready

This checklist has saved me countless hours of debugging and emergency fixes. Adapt it to your specific needs, but don't skip the fundamentals.
